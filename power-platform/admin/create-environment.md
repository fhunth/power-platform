# Create and manage environments in the Power Platform Admin center 
An environment is a space to store, manage, and share your organizationâ€™s business data, apps, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that may have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences. Power Apps automatically creates a single default environment for each tenant, which is shared by all users in that tenant.

> [!TIP]
> For the blog announcing the latest changes to environment creation, see [Provisioning and administration updates are now live in the Power Platform Admin center](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/provisioning-and-administration-updates-are-now-live-in-the-power-platform-admin-center/). 

## Provisioning a new environment
You have a choice when provisioning a new environment. You can:

- Provision based on [buying an environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/admin/add-instance-subscription#add-an-additional-instance) using the Dynamics 365 Admin center.<br />
or <br />
- Provision based on [available capacity](capacity-storage.md#about-the-new-capacity-analytics-reporting). See the section [Create an environment in the Power Platform Admin center](#create-an-environment-in-the-power-platform-admin-center).

### What's new in provisioning environments
We're consolidating how you view, create, and manage environments. 

- **Environments can now be provisioned in the Power Platform Admin center**: You can create environments in the Power Platform Admin center. Previously, environments could only be created in the Dynamics 365 Admin center and the Power Apps Admin center. 
- **Admins can govern environment creation**: To limit environment creation to admins (Dynamics 365 service admins, Office 365 Global admins, or Power Platform service admins), see [Control who can create environments in the Power Platform Admin center](control-environment-creation.md). Previously, limiting was done by controlling who had Power Apps P2 licenses.  
- **Admins can see all environments**: Admins can see all environments (environments with and without a database, and environments with apps) in the Power Platform Admin center. Previously, admins could not see environments created without a database.
- **Trial environment provisioning**: You can create one trial environment per user. Previously, you could create two per user. See [About trial environments](trial-environments.md).

## Who can create environments?
Your license determines whether you can create environments.

| License | Trial | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Office 365 Plans |No | No |
| Dynamics 365 Teams Plans   |No | No |
| Power Apps Community Plan   |No | No |
| Dynamics 365 trial | Yes (one) | No|
| Dynamics 365 Plans |Yes (one)| Yes |
| Power Apps plan |Yes (one)| Yes |
| Power Apps trial |Yes (one)| Yes |

To determine which license a user has, sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) and follow the steps in [Assign licenses to multiple users on the Active users page](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide).

> [!NOTE]
> Office 365 Global admins and Power Platform service admins can create environments without a license. See [Administer without a license](global-service-administrators-can-administer-without-license.md). 

## Create an environment in the Power Platform Admin center
An environment provides storage for apps, flows, data, and various other resources. When users create an app in an environment, that app can connect to any data source, including connections, gateways, and flows. How you choose to leverage environments depends on your organization and the apps you're trying to build. For more information, see [Environments overview](environments-overview.md).

You can store the app/business data in a database with Common Data Service. You can create a database with Common Data Service with any environment.

You have multiple options when creating an environment:

1. [Create an environment with a Common Data Service database](#create-an-environment-with-a-database)
2. [Create an environment without a Common Data Service database](#create-an-environment-without-a-database)

### Some important considerations when creating a new environment

- **Why create an environment with a database**: When you create a production environment with a Common Data Service database, you have the option to add Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Field Service during the creation process (by choosing **Enable Dynamics 365 apps**). Currently, if you don't select **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** at the time of database provisioning, you will not be able to make this change later. 
- **Why create an environment without a database**: If you don't need Dynamics 365 apps or don't need to use Common Data Service, and you are creating Power Apps or Power Automate using other data sources, create the environment without the Common Data Service database.
- **The Enable Dynamics 365 apps decision is not reversible**: Once you create an environment, if you don't select **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** at the time of database provisioning, you will not be able to make this change later.
- **Dynamics 365 apps and trial environments**: Currently, Dynamics 365 apps cannot be enabled for trial environments. To create a trial with Dynamics 365 apps, see [Start your digital transformation here](https://trials.dynamics.com).

## Create an environment with a database
You create a database to use Common Data Service as a data store. The Common Data Service is a cloud scale database used to securely store data for business applications built on Power Apps. Common Data Service provides not just data storage, but a way to implement business logic that enforces business rules and automation against the data. For more information, see [Why use Common Data Service?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#why-use-common-data-service)

### Prerequisites 
To create an environment with a database, you need 1GB available database capacity.

### Steps

1. Sign in to the Power Platform Admin center at [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) as an admin (Dynamics 365 service admin, Office 365 Global admin, or Power Platform service admin).
2. In the navigation pane, select **Environments**, and then select **New**.

## Provision a sandbox environment
To provision a [sandbox environment](sandbox-environments.md), you change a production environment to sandbox.

1. Sign in to the Power Platform Admin center at [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) as an admin (Dynamics 365 service admin, Office 365 Global admin, or Power Platform service admin).

2. From the left-side menu, select **Environments**, and then select a production environment.

3. Select **Edit**

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/select-edit.png "Select Edit")

4. Under **Type**, choose the sandbox environment type.

## FAQ

### Iâ€™m a Dynamics 365 customer. Should I provision using the Dynamics 365 Admin center or Power Platform Admin center?
Power Platform Admin center provisioning is only available for customers who have transitioned to the new capacity-based licenses. If you have not transitioned, please use the Dynamics 365 Admin center for provisioning. 

### What are the new trial limits for Power Apps customers?
The new trial limits are one per user. 

### Can an Office 365 licensed user manage and create environments?
No, Office 365 licensed users will not be able to manage environments. 

### If I create an environment in the Dynamics 365 Admin center, will it appear in the Power Platform Admin center?
Yes, it will appear in both admin centers.

### What is the Power Apps production environment limit?
Provisioning environments is based on database capacity. Previously, it was two environments per Power Apps Plan 2 license. Now all you need is 1GB of available capacity to provision. All environments with or without Common Data Service will consume at least 1GB capacity.
